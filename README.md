Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Christian and I am a Computer Science student at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology ([KIT](https://www.kit.edu/english)).
I've been developing small apps and services for a few years now and am looking forward to contributing more to the open-source world in the future.

If you would like to countribute to my projects feel free to create an issue or a pull request on any of my active projects.
I will read through all of them and include your suggestions ðŸ˜‡

For now, why don't you check out some of my recent work ðŸ˜‰

> P.S. This is my second GitHub account since I didn't like the name of the first one and there are side effects to changing your name. See [@DeveloperTK](https://github.com/DeveloperTK) for some of my older work
